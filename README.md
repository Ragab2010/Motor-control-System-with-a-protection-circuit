# controlling-motors-by-PWM-received-by-UART-with-JSON-format-and-extract-MFC-to-generate-the-duty-cycle

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1)-find the voltage and current sensing values  
set and store voltage sensing , current sensing and power calculation into the 
Correct spot in the JSON format for me to test --- let me test this incorporate into the correct json format to send 
-How to properly change between the MUX

Build , set function and toggle between voltage and current sensing 
-Make sure that you are able to get the correct value 


(2)-Test out PWM value understand what has been done in double pwm.c and ask him to shift and implement code in double pwm
Meaning we need to be able to transmit and access the following 
-Need to test out whether we are able to control the PWM

-(Make sure Json format is exactly the same format as requested by the client meaning I donot want # at the end of the message)

I need to be able to transmit 123 value to control pwm 

(3)Make sure proper formatting of Json based on clients requirement and what my colleagues are using to test the JSON 


(4)write a short circuit protection code to check for short circuit 
-Show the circuit protection to test it and discuss what the short circuit is suppose to do
